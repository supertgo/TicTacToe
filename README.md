The goal of the lesson is to create a AI impossible to win
in TicTacToe.

I`ve learn a lot of things: 

    1 - Create a web page with no global variables.
    2 - Create a AI using the minimax method.
    3 - Create a fake opacity with section.
    4 - I discovered the setTimeOut function
    5 - I discovered how tho reload the page.
